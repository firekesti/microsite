microsite

This is a tiny xhtml strict template I've extracted from some of the sites I've made.

installation

* download to your site (`git clone git://github.com/wickedchicken/microsite`)
* edit `public/index.html`: title, body
* if you want google analytics, uncomment it and put in your web property code
* edit `public/splash.css` if you want to change the colors
* copy `public/index.html` and `public/splash.css` to your web server directory

todo
----
* clean up CSS
* add js to colorify
